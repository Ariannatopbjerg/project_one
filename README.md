## Selected topic
Wildfires across the United States. 

## Reason why we selected this topic
The members of our team live or have lived in the Bay Area of California. A few years ago, when the fires were running rampant, we all experienced ashes raining from the sky and not being able to see the sun for days. This topic touches us personally and piques our interest. To know more about this topic and future potential wildfires, we want to see if it is possible to predict future fires based on past fire data.

## Description of source of data
This dataset is a sub-sample from [1.88 Million US Fires]( https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) combined with historical weather and vegetation data from the website Kaggle.

## Question we hope to answer with this data
Our project consists of analyzing fire data to determine at what accuracy if any, can we predict the next devastating fire. We will clean the input dataset to ultimately demonstrate that we can have any desired results, and that the data can be biased to begin with. Our bias is that California has the most devasting and most frequent wildfires than any other state over the last 5 years. We will utilize the last 24 years of data to predict the next 5 years.
